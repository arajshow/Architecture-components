Unscramble App
===================================

Starter code for Android Basics codelab - Store the data in a ViewModel

It is same as previous app but here i managed to use liveData with data binding to updat variables on screen like score,
wordCounnt and also learn liveData using observer.

These all concept comes under Android Jetpack and this codelab is frome official documentation of android basics in kotlin
